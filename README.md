 # Sweet Shop Management System  

## Overview  

A full-stack Sweet Shop Management System built with **Java (Spring Boot)** for backend and **ReactJS** for frontend, developed using **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** approach using **JUnit 5**.  

## Key Features  

- Add, View, Delete Sweets  
- Search by Name, Category, or Price Range  
- Sort by Price or Quantity (Ascending & Descending)  
- Purchase & Restock with Stock Validation  
- Exception Handling with Custom Errors  
- Responsive, Clean, User-Friendly UI with Bootstrap  
- No Database Used — In-memory List Management

## TDD Journey Highlights  

- Wrote failing tests first (Red)  
- Developed minimal code to pass tests (Green)  
- Refactored and improved code (Refactor) with 100% Coverage
- Handled tests with custom exceptions
- Wrote test cases for each method including edge cases  
- Maintained meaningful Git commits for each step  

## API Highlights  

- **Add Sweet:** `POST /sweetshop/api/sweet/add`  
- **Get All Sweets:** `GET /sweetshop/api/sweet/getAllSweets`  
- **Search, Sort, Purchase, Restock — Fully Functional APIs**  

## AI Usage Policy

- The first attempt of this project was built with ReactJS and a backend on NodeJS, but it faced repeated issues on testing and so i decided to go with spring-boot as a stable framework, about which the implementation of the api endpoint was learnt using ChatGPT
- Authentication layer was debugged a few times with the help of github copilot which is integrated on VS CODE
- This Comprehensive README.md was generated by BOLT AI, although the screenshots was manually added.

## Technologies Used  

### Backend  
- Java 21  
- Spring Boot 3.5.3  
- JUnit 5  
- Maven  
- Custom Exceptions & Services  

### Frontend  
- ReactJS  
- Axios (for API calls)  
- Bootstrap 5  
- React Hot Toast (for user notifications)
